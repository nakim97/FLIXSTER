### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, I found the topics discussed in the labs extremely helpful in preparing me to complete the assignment. In particular I found wednesday's demo and giphy lab crucial for my understanding to work on the assignment. In this week's assignment, I felt unprepared on working with APIs as I didn't have much experience working with API calls & JSON data, but I was able to get a better grasp on the material thanks to the labs!

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time to complete the assignment, I would have written cleaner code and more readable variable/const names. I was a bit rusty on for loops and iterating in javascript, so my code came out a lot more dense than I thought when it could have been done more efficiently and cleaner. Since my code was dense and kept getting longer, I found myself adding various variable names that sounded similar to eachother.

If I could add more features, I would have embedded movie trailers and changed the styling of the modal box. A more ambitious project that I'd like to keep building on is a mock website of Netflix, but instead with movie info. So I'd like to add more css animation effects, responsive features, and modern styling.

My modal box event listener function ran into some bugs, so I would also like to write the function out more efficiently rather than having a jumble of variables/functions within functions!

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Overall the project went well! I came in with a good understanding of HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and felt like the project was a good challenge. As I did not have experience with implementing a modal box feature, I struggled a lot on that component. I ran into a few bugs where the modal box would not close on the second click and the console logged back an "undefined" error multiple times.

I noticed some of my peers implementing cool features like a scroll to top button and embedding movie trailers, so that is definitely something I'd like to try out next time!
